- [x] Proposal
- [ ] Implement the dataset and dataloader
- [x] Implement non-ML baseline (acc:55.4%-68.8%)
- [ ] Data preprocessing (e.g. Fourier Transform, PCA, spectrogram)
  - [ ] time domain (not processed, 1D)
  - [ ] torchaudio.transforms (2D)
  - [ ] torch.fft (1D)
- [ ] ML methods design (may use)
  - [ ] Time domain input
  - [ ] Frequency domain input (e.g. spectrogram)
- [ ] DL methods design (use pytorch architecture)
  - [ ] Time domain input
  - [ ] Frequency domain input
- [ ] Experiment
- [ ] Report
  - [ ] mini “literature survey”, Understand network architectures used in similar models
  - [ ] experimental results with various models (both ML and DL) and performance comparison. Use different architectures and hyperparameters,
  - [ ] evidence of good data handling and processing, i.e., maintain separate test, train, and validation sets.
- [ ] README file(s) that describe the repository structure, execution instructions, and special technical requirements.
